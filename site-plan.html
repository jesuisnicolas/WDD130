      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I’m Nicolas Schaberger, I’m a Web Developer. I design, program, and put online professionally personalized websites. What makes       my company different, is that we also program chatbots for your business. What’s better than an employee that can serve your             clients 24/7? That’s what a chatbot does. A chatbot is a robot that can be programmed and trained to answer your customer’s               questions at any time over multiple platforms. So, I not only design your website, but also put in it an employee that will never         leave the office and will keep your customers happy.<br>
      Your businesses’ website is the window to the online world. If you hire me, I’ll improve that window and attract many more               clients to you.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is any individual or small company who wants to improve their presence on internet with a website according to the current times. Many companies in my area have amateur-looking websites that fail to project a good image on the business they represent. The goal is to develop a website for the client that feels fresh, modern, and innovative.<br>
On the other hand, the chatbots are for the clients who want to improve their communication with customers. A chatbot gives a business instant response time in most cases without the need of a person answering. A chatbot makes a business look more professional and serious.

      <h3>CHATBOTS</h3>
      <p><strong>Why Chatbots?</strong><br>
        In the recent years the communication migrated to the online services. These days is much easier to reach a person or a company through their online presence rather than by phone. The main problem with online communication is that people don’t usually do it during business hours, so, many times customer’s questions remain unanswered until the next business day. Chatbots are here to change it.</p> 
        
        <p><strong>AI Training</strong><br>
          Programmed and trained with Artificial Intelligence, chatbots are able to understand your client and provide programmed answers to satisfy your customers almost as a human being could.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Custom Made</strong><br>
          We design, program and train the chatbots under strict supervision to meet your needs and most higher standards. They are custom made to be part of your company’s team, and not a generic piece of software.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Support 24/7</strong><br>
          Our chatbots are optimized, maintained, and updated constantly to keep them up and running flawlessly. We have a 24/7 support team ready to tackle any problem.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Reliability</strong><br>
          The chatbot can be installed in our servers or in the client side, always under the most strict security standars.</p>
        <p><strong>Multi-Presence</strong><br>
          Chatbots can be used in the website, Facebook and Whatsapp. This way we have all the fronts covered.</p>
